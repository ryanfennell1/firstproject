## TST Scala Exercise V4

### Usage

This project was built in VSCode with the Metals extension. To run it in that environment, simply use the Metals UI to hit run on the main function (consoleApp in Scala.main). Alternatively, you can compile with `sbt compile`, and run it with `sbt run` while in the firstproject directory (directory that contains the build.sbt).

### Testing

To run the unit tests included, either use the metals UI on the PromotionHelperTests and RateHelperTests files, or run `sbt test`.
