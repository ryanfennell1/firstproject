## TST Scala Exercise V4

### Usage

This project was built in VSCode with the Metals extension. To run it in that environment, simply use the Metals UI to hit run on the main function (consoleApp in Scala.main). Alternatively, you should be able to compile with `sbt compile`, and run it with `sbt run`, however this is untested.
